This map shows the process for how a feasible treatment area was determined for prescribed fire in the Central Sierra. For this project, the area of interest is the Cosumnes, American, Bear, and Yuba river watersheds (or CABY region). The feasible treatment area incorporates several key factors:

- Treatable Vegetation (as shown by the elimination of developed areas, grassland, snow, barren, and exotic herbaceous landcovers)
- Areas that are not need of Treatment (as shown by the areas that have recently been burned and/or been treated recently)
- Areas Where Prescribed Fire is Not Safe (as shown by High Voltage Power Lines and the Wildland Urban Interface)
- Access to Treatment Sites (as shown by Roadless Areas)



Each of these layers can be turned on or off in the upper right hand corner of the map to see how the influenced the final feasibility area. The black feasibility polygon depicts areas where prescribed fire would not be a feasible fuel treatment.
